# Predicting Mitochondrial Toxicity of Drugs Using Tox21’s SR-MMP Dataset

**Introduction**

**What are Mitochondria?**

A mitochondrion is a membrane-bound organelle found in the cytoplasm of almost all eukaryotic cells (cells with clearly defined nuclei), the primary function of which is to generate large quantities of energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Mitochondria are typically round to oval in shape and range in size from 0.5 to 10 μm. In addition to producing energy, mitochondria store calcium for cell signaling activities, generate heat, and mediate cell growth and death [1](https://www.britannica.com/science/mitochondrion)

**Mitochondrial Toxicity: Definition and Impact**

Mitochondrial Toxicity can be broadly defined as damage or dysfunction of the mitochondria, which can lead to various health problems, including muscle weakness, pancreatitis, and liver issues. 
Mitochondrial function is critical for health. This is demonstrated both by the large number of diseases caused by mutations in genes found in the nucleus and mitochondria, and by the critical role that mitochondrial dysfunction plays in a large number of chronic diseases [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5681391/). 

Mitochondrial Dysfunction is linked to:
- Myopathy (muscle disease)
- Neurodegenerative Disorders (e.g Parkinson's disease)
- Cancer

## Project Overview:
This project builds a predictive machine learning model trained on the TOX 21's SR-MMP dataset, which contains qualitative toxicity measurements for 5,810 compounds. Given a drug SMILES string, the model predicts it's mitochondrial toxicity.
